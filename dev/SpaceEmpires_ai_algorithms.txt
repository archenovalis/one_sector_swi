Economy Score Algorithm (Empire and Sector):
Description: 

    Measures the economic vitality of the empire, considering resource management, trade, and market dynamics.


Components:

    Resource Scores for Empire: For each resource type:
        Availability: Resources available to be extracted.
        On Hand: Current inventory, accounting for storage capacity.
        Extraction Rate: Number of each size of mining ships.
        Transport Efficiency: Number of container trading and piracy risks (calculated based on number of pirate attacks over last x number of cycles).
        Market Demand: Max production demands for intermediate and end products, and resources spent building ship and stations.
        Market Saturation: On hand divided by demand.

Influence:

    High economy scores drive expansion; lower scores push for consolidation.




Military Score Algorithm:
Description: 

    Evaluates the empire's military preparedness, combining both defensive and offensive capabilities.


Components:

    Defensive Structures: Number of defensive stations (minimum 2 per border sector (a sector that borders a neutral zone (a sector that borders another empire)), minimum 1 per core sector(non-border sectors), minimum 2(minimum 1 if no enemy empires are known) per sector with shipyard/wharf/planetary tradestation).
    Defensive Ships: Border guards and sector-specific defense forces.
    Offensive Ships: Patrol ships, commandeerable for offensive operations.
    Recon Ships: Number of recon ships.

Influence:

    Dictates when to transition into defense state (a non-war defense focused consolidation state) and between war_invade, war_consolidate, and war_defense (war states are only available when at war), and impacts strategic decisions like declaring war, accepting peace, and requesting peace.




Industry Score Algorithm:
Description: 

    Assesses the industrial output capacity and flexibility of the empire.


Components:

    Ship Building:
        Demand: Current list of requested ships.
        Production Capacity: Number of slots of each size (Wharf buildmodules can build S and M, and each Shipyard buildmodule is limited to building L, XL, or XXL).
        Downtime: How much downtime each module had during the last x cycles
    Station Building: 
        Demand: Current list of requested stations.
        Construction Ships: Number of station construction by size (L and XL).
        Downtime: How much downtime each construction ship had during the last x cycles


Influence:

    Indicates readiness for expansion.
