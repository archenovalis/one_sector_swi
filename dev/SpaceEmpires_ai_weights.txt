Calculating Weights and Factors:

    Weights: These should reflect strategic priorities:
        Static Weights: For example, in military_score, defensive structures might always have a weight of 0.4 because they're foundational for any defense strategy.
        Dynamic Weights: Depending on the game's balance or player feedback, you might adjust weights. For instance, if players find offense too strong, you could decrease the weight of offensive_ships in military_score.
    Factors: These can be constant values used to normalize scores or highlight specific aspects:
        Normalization Factors: Used to scale scores into a common range (e.g., 0-1). For example, max_logistics_score in logistics calculation ensures logistics scores are comparable across different empire sizes.
        Impact Factors: Like piracy_risk_factor or route_length_impact, set based on game world design or player experience to reflect how much these elements affect gameplay.


Determining Weights and Factors:

    Game Balance: Through testing or player feedback, adjust weights to ensure no single aspect (economy, military, industry) becomes overwhelmingly advantageous.
    Design Philosophy: If the game emphasizes exploration over combat, weights might favor economy and industry scores.


State Influence on Scores:

    Affecting Scores Directly:
        State-Specific Weight Adjustments: In the War state, you might increase the weight of military components in all scores to reflect a focus on survival or conquest.
        Score Calculation Modifications: Certain states might modify how scores are calculated; for example, in Expansion, perhaps resource availability is weighted more heavily in the economy score to prioritize growth.
    Affecting Build Order:
        Priority Queue: Instead of altering scores, the state could influence what gets built first. For example:
            In Expansion State, prioritize exploration ships and mining stations.
            In Defense State, prioritize defensive structures and ships.
            In War State, focus on offensive ships and logistics for supply.
    Hybrid Approach:
        Use both methods. Scores guide what's generally important, but the state dictates the immediate build priority. For instance, even if the economy score is high, in War state, you'd build military assets before economic ones.


Determining and Setting Trigger Thresholds:

    Baseline Thresholds:
        Historical Data: Use data from previous games or simulations to set initial thresholds. For example, if historically, an empire with a military score below 0.5 always gets invaded, that could be your defense threshold.
        Gameplay Goals: Define what you want players to feel at different stages. If the goal is tension when under threat, set defense thresholds low.
    Dynamic Thresholds:
        Adaptive: Thresholds might adjust based on player progress or game events. If the player has been very expansionist, thresholds for defense might lower to reflect increased vulnerability.
        State-Dependent: Thresholds could be different in each state. In Expansion, the threshold for moving to Consolidation might be lower than moving to Defense.
    Setting Thresholds:
        Constants: Define constants like ECON_THRESHOLD_EXPANSION or MIL_THRESHOLD_WAR.
        Algorithm: Use a formula to set them based on current scores or state duration. For example:
        python

def set_threshold(current_score, state_duration, base_threshold):
    # Example formula where thresholds adjust based on how long in state
    return base_threshold + (current_score * (state_duration / 100))
