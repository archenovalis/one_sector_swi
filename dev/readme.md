adds scoring algorithms to factionlogic. tracking resources available, mining/transporting efficiency, on-hand, sector values

scores determine state of the faction: expanding, consolidating, defense

state and scores determine build priority of ships and stations

no need to hardcode shipyards/tradestations/etc. factions will no longer spam unbuilt stations when they are reduced to (or start with) a single sector
