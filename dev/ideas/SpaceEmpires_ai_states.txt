States and Their Conditions, Triggers, and Score Influences:
1. Expansion State:
Description:  

    Focuses on growth, exploring new sectors, setting up resource extraction, and manufacturing facilities.


Conditions:

    No immediate threats: No enemy sectors or recent attacks nearby.
    Stable economy: Economy score > ECON_THRESHOLD_EXPANSION indicating resource surplus.
    Sufficient military readiness: Military score > MIL_THRESHOLD_BASELINE for basic defense.


Score Influence:

    Economy Score: Encourages expansion when high due to resource abundance.
    Industry Score: Focuses on building exploration and mining ships.
    Military Score: Maintained at baseline to avoid vulnerabilities.


Transition Triggers:

    To Consolidation: When economy or industry scores plateau, or new sectors need fortification. Check if Economy Score < ECON_THRESHOLD_CONSOLIDATION or if sectors are not fully integrated.
    To Defense: When new enemy factions are detected or enemy activity increases near borders.


2. Consolidation State:
Description:  

    Strengthens infrastructure, optimizes resource distribution, and prepares for potential future threats.


Conditions:

    Post-expansion stability: Sectors claimed but not optimized.
    No immediate threats: But a need for infrastructural consolidation.


Score Influence:

    Economy Score: Should increase with integration; if not, signals further consolidation needed.
    Industry Score: Prioritizes upgrading existing industries or optimizing production.
    Military Score: Might increase if new defenses are needed.


Transition Triggers:

    Back to Expansion: When sectors are stable (Economy Score > ECON_THRESHOLD_EXPANSION and Industry Score > IND_THRESHOLD_EXPANSION).
    To Defense: Upon detection of potential threats or enemies approaching.


3. Defense State:
Description:  

    Prepares for potential conflict by enhancing defenses, increasing surveillance, and fortifying sectors.


Conditions:

    Enemy detection: Through reconnaissance or proximity to enemy sectors.
    Adequate military readiness: Military score > MIL_THRESHOLD_DEFENSE for deterrence.


Score Influence:

    Economy Score: Might decrease due to military reallocation, but stability is crucial.
    Industry Score: Shifts focus to defensive structures and ships.
    Military Score: Becomes primary focus for deterrence or preparation.


Transition Triggers:

    To War: If enemy threats escalate or strategic sectors are threatened.
    Back to Consolidation: When threat level decreases, allowing for rebuilding.


4. War State:
Description:  

    Full military mobilization, focusing on combat, territory control, or defense against invasion.


Conditions:

    Active conflict: Engaging with enemies through attacks or territorial disputes.
    High military readiness: Military score significantly increased from war preparations.


Score Influence:

    Economy Score: Strained as resources are diverted to war; focuses on military support.
    Industry Score: Prioritizes military production, potentially at the cost of civilian industry.
    Military Score: Highest priority, aiming to maximize for effective combat.


Transition Triggers:

    To Defense: Once immediate threats are managed or after major engagements.
    To Consolidation: After conflict resolution, for rebuilding and integration.


Interaction Between States and Scores:

    State Transitions: 
        Defined by comparing current scores against thresholds like ECON_THRESHOLD_CONSOLIDATION, MIL_THRESHOLD_WAR, etc.
    Scores as Decision Makers:
        Economy: Influences expansion or consolidation based on resource levels.
        Industry: Affects speed of response to state changes via production capabilities.
        Military: Determines readiness for war or defense.
    Feedback Loop:
        Entering a state adjusts score calculation (e.g., weighting military more in war). 
        State achievements update scores: defeating enemies increases military score, new sectors boost economy score.


Determining Conditions:

    Threat Detection: Monitor enemy data via reconnaissance or espionage.
    Economic Indicators: Regularly assess resource levels, market demand, and saturation.
    Military Readiness: Keep track of ship types, numbers, and defense installations.
    Industrial Output: Monitor construction queues and production rates.
    Score Thresholds: Use dynamic thresholds based on past performance and current strategy.
    Event-Based Triggers: Respond to significant events like territorial changes or resource finds.
