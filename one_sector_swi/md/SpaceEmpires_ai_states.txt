States and Their Conditions:
1. Expansion State:

    Conditions:
        No active threats (no known enemies within a certain proximity or no recent attacks).
        Current sectors are stable (defense score is above a threshold).
        Resource availability for expansion (economy score indicates surplus).
    Score Influence:
        Economy Score: High scores here would encourage entering this state to capitalize on resource abundance for growth.
        Industry Score: The focus would be on building ships for exploration and setting up new mining or manufacturing stations.
        Military Score: Maintained at a baseline to prevent vulnerabilities but not the primary focus.


2. Consolidation State:

    Conditions:
        After an expansion phase or when new sectors have been added but not yet optimized.
        No immediate threat but a need to strengthen infrastructure post-expansion.
    Score Influence:
        Economy Score: Should rise as new resources become integrated; if not, it might signal a need for further consolidation.
        Industry Score: High priority as this state would involve upgrading or optimizing existing industries.
        Military Score: Might see an uptick if defensive structures are being built to secure new territories.


3. Defense State:

    Conditions:
        Detection of enemy presence or activity but not yet engaged in combat.
        Threat level requires defensive preparation but not full mobilization.
    Score Influence:
        Economy Score: Might dip due to reallocation of resources to military needs, but stability is key.
        Industry Score: Shifts towards producing defensive ships and structures, possibly slowing down other industrial outputs.
        Military Score: This becomes the focus, aiming to increase to deter or prepare for potential conflicts.


4. War State:

    Conditions:
        Engaged in active combat with another faction.
        Immediate need for military action to protect or expand territories.
    Score Influence:
        Economy Score: Likely to be strained as resources are heavily diverted to the war effort. Economic activity might focus on supporting the military.
        Industry Score: Would prioritize military production, potentially at the expense of other industrial activities unless they directly support the war.
        Military Score: The highest priority, with resources and production aimed at increasing this score to win conflicts or defend effectively.


Interaction Between States and Scores:

    State Transitions: 
        From Expansion to Consolidation: Triggered when economic or industrial growth plateaus or when new sectors need to be fortified.
        From Consolidation to Defense: Occurs when enemies are detected or intelligence reports suggest potential threats.
        From Defense to War: When threats escalate into actual engagements or strategic sectors are at risk.
        From War back to Defense or Consolidation: When the immediate threat is neutralized or when the need for military action decreases, focusing back on rebuilding or securing gains.
    Score as Decision Makers:
        Economy Score: Influences decisions on when to expand or consolidate. A high score might push towards expansion or investment in industry.
        Industry Score: Determines how quickly the empire can respond to new states by building necessary ships or structures.
        Military Score: Directly affects when to shift from defensive to offensive actions or vice versa based on readiness and threat level.
    Feedback Loop: Each state should feed back into the scores:
        Entering a new state should adjust the priorities reflected in how scores are calculated or weighted. 
        Achievements within a state (like securing a sector or defeating enemies) would update the scores, influencing when to transition to another state.

1. Expansion State:

    Description: The empire focuses on growth, exploring new sectors, and setting up new resource extraction and manufacturing facilities.
    Conditions:
        No immediate threats (no enemy sectors nearby or no recent attacks).
        Stable economy (economy score above a certain threshold indicating resource surplus).
        Sufficient military readiness (military score at a level where defense is not compromised).
    Transition Triggers:
        To Consolidation: When new sectors have been claimed but not yet fully integrated, or when resource growth slows (economy score plateaus).
        To Defense: Detection of new enemy factions or increased activity from known ones within proximity.


2. Consolidation State:

    Description: Focus on strengthening existing infrastructure, optimizing resource distribution, and preparing for potential threats.
    Conditions:
        Post-expansion stability (new sectors are claimed but need development).
        No immediate threats but a need to secure and optimize recent expansions.
    Transition Triggers:
        Back to Expansion: Once sectors are well-established, resources are flowing, and there's a surplus for further expansion (high economy and industry scores).
        To Defense: When intelligence suggests potential threats or enemies are getting closer.


3. Defense State:

    Description: The empire prepares for potential conflict by strengthening defenses, increasing surveillance, and possibly fortifying key sectors.
    Conditions:
        Detection of enemy activity (either through reconnaissance or proximity to enemy sectors).
        Military score needs to be adequate for deterrence but not necessarily at war levels.
    Transition Triggers:
        To War: If enemy actions escalate or if strategic sectors are at risk.
        Back to Consolidation: If the threat diminishes or is neutralized, allowing for a return to growth and optimization.


4. War State:

    Description: Full mobilization of military resources, focusing on combat, capturing enemy sectors, or defending against invasion.
    Conditions:
        Active conflict with enemies, either through direct attacks or significant territorial disputes.
        High military readiness (increased military score from production of war assets).
    Transition Triggers:
        To Defense: When the immediate threat is reduced or after major engagements, shifting focus to securing gains or preventing counterattacks.
        To Consolidation: Once the conflict ends, to rebuild and integrate any newly acquired sectors.


Determining Conditions:

    Threat Detection: 
        Use reconnaissance ships to gather data on enemy movements or claims. 
        Monitor for changes in enemy military or economic activity through espionage or trade.
    Economic Indicators:
        Resource Availability: Compare current resource levels against consumption and production rates.
        Market Dynamics: Assess demand and saturation through trade data.
    Military Readiness:
        Ship Counts and Types: Regularly update counts of defensive, offensive, and support ships.
        Defense Installations: Check the status and coverage of defensive stations across sectors.
    Industrial Output:
        Construction and Manufacturing Queues: Monitor how quickly new ships, stations, or upgrades are being produced.
    Score Thresholds:
        Set dynamic thresholds for scores based on historical data, current state, and strategic goals. For instance, a military score might need to be above x to transition from Defense to War.
    Event-Based Triggers:
        Certain events like enemy sector claim near borders, or significant resource discovery can force state changes.
