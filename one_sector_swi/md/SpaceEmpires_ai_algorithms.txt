Economy Score Algorithm:
Description: 

    Measures the economic vitality of the empire, considering resource management, trade, and market dynamics.


Components:

    Resource Scores: For each resource type:
        Availability: How accessible resources are within claimed sectors.
        On Hand: Current inventory, accounting for storage capacity.
        Extraction Rate: Efficiency of mining ships and facilities, adjusted for wear and upgrades.
        Transport Efficiency: Logistics effectiveness, including ship speed, trade routes, and piracy risks.
        Market Demand: Demand within the empire and through trade with others, including export potential.
        Market Saturation: How saturated the market is for each resource, potentially lowering value.
        Trade Agreements: Positive or negative impacts from trade deals.


Formula:
def calculate_resource_score(availability, on_hand, extraction_rate, transport_efficiency, demand, saturation, trade_impact):
    # Adjustable weights for each factor
    weighted_availability = availability * 0.3
    weighted_on_hand = on_hand * 0.2
    weighted_extraction = extraction_rate * 0.2
    weighted_transport = transport_efficiency * 0.1
    weighted_demand = demand * 0.1
    weighted_saturation = (1 - saturation) * 0.1
    
    # Trade deals can boost or reduce the score
    return (weighted_availability + weighted_on_hand + weighted_extraction + weighted_transport + 
            weighted_demand + weighted_saturation) * (1 + trade_impact)

def economy_score(resources):
    resource_scores = [calculate_resource_score(r['availability'], r['on_hand'], r['extraction_rate'], 
                                                r['transport_efficiency'], r['demand'], r['saturation'], 
                                                r['trade_impact']) for r in resources]
    return sum(resource_scores) / len(resource_scores) if resources else 0


Influence:

    High economy scores drive expansion or investment in new industries; lower scores might push for consolidation or trade negotiations.




Military Score Algorithm:
Description: 

    Evaluates the empire's military preparedness, combining both defensive and offensive capabilities.


Components:

    Defensive Structures: Including stations, forts, and automated defenses.
    Defensive Ships: Patrols, border guards, and sector-specific defense forces.
    Offensive Ships: Fleets for combat or strategic strikes, including carrier support.
    Logistics: Supply lines, repair capabilities, and the ability to sustain long engagements.
    Intelligence: Quality of reconnaissance and espionage affecting strategic advantage.


Formula:
def military_score(defensive_structures, defensive_ships, offensive_ships, logistics, intelligence):
    # Weighting reflects strategic importance
    defensive_score = sum(defensive_structures) * 0.4 + sum(defensive_ships) * 0.3
    offensive_score = sum(offensive_ships) * 0.5
    return (defensive_score + offensive_score) * (1 + logistics * 0.1 + intelligence * 0.1)


Influence:

    Dictates when to transition into or out of war or defense states, impacts strategic decisions like launching attacks or fortifying.




Industry Score Algorithm:
Description: 

    Assesses the industrial output capacity and flexibility of the empire.


Components:

    Ship Types: Mining, transport, combat (offensive/defensive), construction:
        Demand: Immediate and forecasted based on current state and expansion plans.
        Production Capacity: Number, efficiency, and specialization of shipyards.
        Current Production: What's currently in the queue or being produced.
        Upgrade Potential: Ability to improve existing ships or facilities.
    Station Building: 
        Demand for New Stations: Based on strategic needs, resource availability, and expansion goals.
        Construction Ships: Number and efficiency of ships capable of station construction.
        Resource Availability: For station construction, considering both on-hand and extractable resources.
        Construction Speed: How quickly new stations can be built or existing ones upgraded.


Formula:
def ship_type_score(demand, production_capacity, current_production, upgrade_potential):
    return ((current_production / demand if demand > 0 else 1) * 
            (production_capacity / max_production_capacity) * 
            (1 + upgrade_potential * 0.1))

def station_building_score(demand, construction_ships, resource_availability, construction_speed):
    return (demand / (demand + construction_ships)) * resource_availability * construction_speed

def industry_score(ship_types, stations):
    ship_scores = [ship_type_score(type['demand'], type['production_capacity'], type['current_production'], 
                                   type['upgrade_potential']) for type in ship_types]
    station_score = station_building_score(stations['demand'], stations['construction_ships'], 
                                           stations['resource_availability'], stations['construction_speed'])
    return (sum(ship_scores) / len(ship_scores) if ship_scores else 0) * station_score


Influence:

    Indicates readiness for expansion, the ability to shift production focus (e.g., from civilian to military needs), and how well the empire can adapt to new strategic demands.
